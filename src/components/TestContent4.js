Obesity rates in America are highest among adults over age 40. 
    This is the age when hormone levels begin to shift and decline. 
    A hormone imbalance can change the body composition percentage with 
    a decrease in lean muscle and an increase in fat mass. Major triggers of hormone
     imbalances are chronic stress, lack of sleep, poor dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle. 
     An undetected hormone imbalance may be sabotaging your weight management program and 
     raising your risk of chronic illness. <br/>

 beyond standard screening methods to determine an individualâ€™s health risk.</p>
