						Hormone imbalance can lead to fat storage <br />
						Obesity rates in America are highest among adults over age 40. This is the age when hormone
						levels begin to shift and decline. A hormone imbalance can change the body composition
						percentage with a decrease in lean muscle and an increase in fat mass. Major triggers of hormone
						imbalances are chronic stress, lack of sleep, poor dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle. An
						undetected hormone imbalance may be sabotaging your weight management program and raising your
						risk of chronic illness. <br />
						With innovative blood tests, Easylabs.org research and science goes far beyond standard
						screening methods to determine an individualâ€™s health risk.
